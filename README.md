# grandpas-radio
This project is for a friend who asked me if I could update his grandfather's old hand held radio to a blue tooth player. I let him know that all he had to do was buy a bt player gut it and essentially hack it into place. He asked if I would do it for him and I agreed. When it came down to drilling on the old player I could not bring myself to it. I eventually told him he would have to come over and do the drilling. Needless to say COVID happended and a few years passed and I had an idea. I would put my electronic and programming skills to work and make a radio that would have bt capabillities, incorporate the original controls and would retain all its aesthetic qualities.  

Searching I found several projects online and decided to start with [MrBuddyCasino's Web Radio](https://github.com/MrBuddyCasino/ESP32_MP3_Decoder) as the base. This has a bonus of having web radio capabillities. The idea now is that given enough memory I will add to it the abillity to switch radio stations and to the bt by the tuner control of the radio. And, given enough memory serve a small web page that will allow you to set-up the wifi, bt and radio stations.
